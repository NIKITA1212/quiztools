This project has all its important files in a Git repository at

  https://github.com/hplgit/quiztools/

It means that the files are stored in the cloud and the Git system keeps
track of who does what when with the files such that it is possible to roll
back to previous versions of a file, and if two work at a file at the same
time, Git is usually able to merge the edits correctly.

To copy the present of files to your own computer, do

 Terminal> git clone git@github.com:hplgit/quiztools.git

This creates a directory tree inf1100-quiz, known as the project directory.

Every time you work with this project do the following command in the
project directory:

 Terminal> git pull origin master

When you have finished work for some hours or the day, do

 Terminal> git commit -am 'Some quick description of what you have done...'
 Terminal> git push origin master

If you create a new file, say myfile.txt, remember to register it with Git:

 Terminal> git add myfile.txt

You probably don't need to know more about Git than these commands, but if
you are curious, you may check out an intro

===== Installing and working with DocOnce =====

DocOnce is a markup language for writing documents in a simple text
format and automatically creating beautiful documents in LaTeX, HTML,
and other formats. To install DocOnce, do

  Terminal> git clone https://github.com/hplgit/doconce.git  # takes some time..
  Terminal> cd doconce
  Terminal> sudo python setup.py install

DocOnce is frequently updated. To install the latest version some time in
the future, do

  Terminal> cd doconce
  Terminal> git pull origin master
  Terminal> sudo python setup.py install

Several commands are needed to compile a DocOnce document into LaTeX/PDF or
HTML. See the demo/make.sh file for how this is done. Usually it is
sufficient to run

  Terminal> sh -x make.sh

to compile the document.
