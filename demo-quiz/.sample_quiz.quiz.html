The equation

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0
\label{cont:eq}
\end{equation}
$$

is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):
<!-- --- end quiz question --- -->
<!-- --- keywords: ['gradient', 'divergence', 'curl', 'vector calculus'] -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->
The equation tells that the net outflow of something with
velocity \( \boldsymbol{u} \) in region is zero.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 1 --- -->
This is right: integrating \eqref{cont:eq} over an arbitrary domain
\( \Omega \) and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we get the surface integral

$$ \int_{\partial\Omega}\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}dS=0,$$

where \( \boldsymbol{n} \) is an outward unit normal on the boundary \( \partial\Omega \).
The quantity \( \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}dS \) is the outflow of volume per
time unit if \( \boldsymbol{u} \) is velocity.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 1 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->
The equation tells that the vector field \( \boldsymbol{u} \) is divergence free.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
Yes, <em>divergence free</em> is often used as synonym for <em>zero divergence</em>,
and \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} \) is the divergence of a vector field \( \boldsymbol{u} \).
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 2 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->
The equation implies that there exists a vector potential \( \boldsymbol{A} \)
such that \( \boldsymbol{u}=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{A} \).
<!-- --- end quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 3 --- -->
Yes, this is an important result in vector calculus that is much
used in electromagnetics.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 3 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->
The equation implies \( \nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}=0 \).
<!-- --- end quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 4 --- -->
No, only if \( \boldsymbol{u}=\nabla\phi \), for some scalar potential \( \phi \),
we have \( \nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}=0 \).
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 4 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 5 (right) --- -->
The equation implies that \( \boldsymbol{u} \) must be a constant vector field.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 5 (right) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 5 --- -->
No, it is the <em>sum</em> of derivatives of different components of \( \boldsymbol{u} \)
that is zero. Only in one dimension, where \( \boldsymbol{u}=u_x\boldsymbol{i} \)
and consequently \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=du/dx \), the vector field must be constant.

We want to create a Python list object of length <code>n</code> where each

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->
Yes.

<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 1 --- -->
Not exactly: <code>numpy.zeros</code> creates an array of zeros, not a list.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 1 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->
Yes, provided we write <code>np</code> instead of <code>numpy</code>:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->

</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
No, this is fully equivalent to the original code, so <code>mylist</code> becomes
an array, not a list.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 2 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 3 (right) --- -->
No.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 3 (right) --- -->

The purpose of this program is to differentiate the two mathematical
functions

$$
\begin{align*}
u(t) &= t^2,\\
f(x) &= 2x.
\end{align*}
$$

Determine which of the following assertions that is <b>wrong</b>.
<!-- --- end quiz question --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->
In Python, the syntax for \( t^2 \) is <code>t**2</code>, not <code>t^2</code>, so the
<code>u</code> function contains an error.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 1 --- -->
True. However, <code>t^2</code> will work for integer <code>t</code> in Python, but the computation is nonsense in this case since \( u(t) \) is supposed to be \( t^2 \).
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 1 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->
The string in the <code>u</code> function is a valid doc string.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
Yes, a doc string can be any string after the function heading. It can
have single quotes <code>'...'</code>, double quotes <code>"..."</code>,
triple single quotes <code>'''...'''</code>, or triple double quotes <code>"""..."""</code>.
The latter is the most popular for doc strings. Recall that triple quotes
allow the string to span multiple lines.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 2 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->
The output from the program is on a single line, despite two <code>print</code>
statements.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 3 --- -->
Yes, because of the comma after the first <code>print</code> statement: it suppresses
the newline character that is normally appended to <code>print</code> statements in
Python.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 3 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->
One cannot use <code>u</code> both inside the <code>D</code> function and in the
outer calling code (the main program).
<!-- --- end quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 4 --- -->
Yes, you can, because the <code>u</code> argument in the <code>D</code> function
(holding a function)
is a <em>local</em> variable inside the <code>D</code> function. The <code>u</code> in the calling
code is <em>global</em> variable, holding a function object.
Inside <code>D</code>, <code>u</code> refers to the
local variable, while in the main program, <code>u</code> refers to the
global variable, and the local variable <code>u</code> in <code>D</code> no longer exists, because
it was deleted when returning from the function.
Inside <code>D</code>, we can actually access the global <code>u</code> by <code>globals()['u']</code>,
but that almost never comes to use and is also bad coding.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 4 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 5 (wrong) --- -->
The call <code>D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)</code> is equivalent to defining

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>x
</pre></div>
<p>
and then calling <code>D(f, 2)</code>.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 5 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 5 --- -->
<code>f(x)</code> is defined as a lambda function, which is a short-hand for
defining functions as an expression, in a function call as here, or
in the right-hand side of an assignment, e.g.,

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">f <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">lambda</span> x: <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>x
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 5 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 6 (wrong) --- -->
There is danger of integer division in the <code>D</code> function.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 6 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 6 --- -->
True, here is an example: <code>D(lambda t: t, dt=1)</code>. We get
<code>(t+1 - t-1)/(2*1)</code>, which for any integer <code>t</code> gives <code>int/int</code>
and hence integer division.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 6 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 7 (wrong) --- -->
The <code>D</code> function computes an approximate derivative of the
function <code>u(t)</code>.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 7 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 7 --- -->
Yes, <code>D</code> applies a widely used finite difference approximation
formula to the derivative.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 7 --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin quiz choice 8 (wrong) --- -->
Both calls to <code>D</code> results in the exact derivative, provided we
replace <code>t^2</code> by <code>t**2</code>.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 8 (wrong) --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 8 --- -->
Yes, the finite difference approximation used in <code>D</code> is exact
for quadratic polynomials!
